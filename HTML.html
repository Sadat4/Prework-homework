    <h1 >IBM Personal Computer, 1981</h1>
    <p>The computer that kickstarted the whole third-party revolution of ‘IBM compatible’ accessories, the IBM Personal<br>
         Computer was the first computer to be officially named a PC. Despite having its own superior parts and operating <br>
         system, IBM uncharacteristically used Intel’s 8088 processor, off-the-shelf parts and Microsoft’s DOS, and in doing so <br>
          left its PC open.</p>
    <p>
        Its overnight success prompted an explosion of compatible software, hardware and peripherals leaving everything else in <br>
        its wake, spawning the burgeoning PC industry.
